# awesome-bash-profile
This is my full .bash_profile for Mac. It includes a lot of bash aliases, shortcuts and functionalities to make my life easier. Feel free to take whatever you find useful :)

## Quick Start
Open your terminal and run the following command:

```sh
    $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/entpnomad/awesome-bash-profile/master/bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
```   

Alternatively, you can open your .bash_profile and add only the features you need: 

```sh
    $ vi ~/.bash_profile
```   

Please send me feedback and suggestions!
